# Classification

Melanoma
Dataset of patients with malignant melanoma with measurement of thickness of the tumour and ulcer-  important prognostic variables in that patients with a thick and/or ulcerated tumour have an increased chance of death from melanoma. 
Data cleaning, data preprocessing, model building, feature engineering, satistical analysis, hypothesis testing and regression.
Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn: high-level functions, statsmodel, scikit-learn: RandomForestClassifier

Credit Card
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. Highly imbalanced dataset. Undersampled and oversampled dataset transformation - cleaned from outliers and perform logistic regression on them in order to compare the results.
Data cleaning, data preprocessing, feature engineering, under and oversampling, scaling, model building and evalutation.
Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn: logistics regression, isolation forest, RandomForestClassifier, standardscaler.
